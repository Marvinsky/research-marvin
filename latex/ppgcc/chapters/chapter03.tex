\section{Problem Formulation}
% ---
When solving $\nabla$ using the consistent heuristic function $h_{max}(\zeta\sp{'})$ for $\zeta\sp{'} \subseteq \zeta$, A$\sp{*}$ expands in the worst case $J(\zeta\sp{'}, \nabla)$ nodes, where

\begin{equation}
J(\zeta\sp{'},\nabla) = |\{s \in V | f_{max}(s,\zeta\sp{'}) \leq C\sp{*}\}|
\label{eq:eq_size_search_tree_1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
J(\zeta\sp{'},\nabla) = |\{s \in V | h_{max}(s,\zeta\sp{'}) \leq C\sp{*} - g(s)\}|
\label{eq:eq_size_search_tree_2}
\end{equation}

We present a greedy algorithm for approximately solving the following optimization problem,

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\textbf{minimize}_{\zeta\sp{'} \in 2\sp{|\zeta|}}J(\zeta\sp{'}, \nabla) \\
\textbf{subject to} |\zeta\sp{'} = N|
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Where $N$ could be determined by a hard constraint such as the maximum number of \texttt{PDBs} one can store in memory.

\section{GHS Algorithm}
% ---
\noindent
Algorithm \ref{alg:ghs_algorithm} presents Greedy Heuristic Selection (\texttt{GHS}), an approximation algorithm for selecting a subset $\zeta\sp{'} \subseteq \zeta$.

The algorithm receives as input a planning problem $\nabla$, a set of heuristics $\zeta$, a cardinality size $N$, and it returns a subset $\zeta\sp{'} \subseteq \zeta$ of size $N$. In each iteration \texttt{GHS} greedily selects from $\zeta$ the heuristic $h$ which will result in the largest reduction of the value of $J$ (line 3). \texttt{GHS} returns $\zeta\sp{'}$ once it has the desired cardinality size $N$.\\

\begin{algorithm}[H]
 
\textbf{Input:} Problem $\nabla$, set  of heuristics $\zeta$, cardinality $N$
 
\textbf{Ouput:} heuristic subset $\zeta\sp{'} \subseteq \zeta$ of size $N$
 
$\zeta\sp{'} \leftarrow \emptyset$
 
\While{$|\zeta\sp{'}| < N$ do} {
 
	$h \leftarrow \texttt{argmin}_{h \in \zeta} J(\zeta\sp{'} \cup \{h\}, \nabla) $
 
	$\zeta\sp{'} \leftarrow \zeta\sp{'} \cup \{h\}$
 
	return $\zeta\sp{'}$
}

\subsection{GHS Approximation Analysis}
In the following analysis all heuristic functions are assumed to be consistent. We also assume that A$\sp{*}$ expands all nodes $n$ with $f(n) \leq C\sp{*}$ while solving $\nabla$, as shown in Equation \eqref{eq:eq_size_search_tree_1}.

\begin{lemma}
$J(\zeta\sp{'} \cup \{h\}) \leq J(\zeta\sp{'})$ for any $\zeta\sp{'}$ and any h.

Proof. Fix $\zeta\sp{'}$ and h. Then

$J(\zeta\sp{'} \cup \{h\})  =  |\{s \in V | h_{max}(s, \zeta\sp{'} \cup \{h\}) \leq C\sp{*} - g(s)\}|\\
\hspace*{3.3cm} \leq  |\{s \in V | h_{max}(s,\zeta\sp{'}) \leq C\sp{*} - g(s)\}|\\
\hspace*{3.3cm} = J(\zeta\sp{'}) $

Where the inequality follows from the fact that $h_{max}(s,\zeta\sp{'} \cup \{h\}) \geq h_{max}(s,\zeta\sp{'})$ for all s. \\

Let $S$ be a set and $\phi$ a function over $2\sp{S}$. $\phi$ is supermodular if for any $A, B, x$ with $A \subset B \subset S$ and $x \in S \backslash B:$

\begin{equation}
\phi(A) - \phi(A \cup \{x\}) \geq \phi(B) - \phi(B \cup \{x\})
\label{eq:function_phi}
\end{equation}

Intuitively, Equation \ref{eq:function_phi} captures the idea of disminishing returns. In the context of search tree size, if we add a heuristic function $h$ to a set of heuristics $A$ strictly contained in a set $B$, then we would expect, then we would expect $J(A) - J(A \cup \{h\})$ to be larger than $J(B) - J(B \cup \{h\})$ as $h$ would "contribute more" to $A$ than to $B$.
\label{le:lemmaone}
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
$J$ is supermodular. \\
Proof. Let $A \subset B \subset \zeta$ and $h \in \zeta \backslash B.$ By Lemma \ref{le:lemmaone}, $J(A) - J(A \cup \{h\}) \geq 0$ and $J(B) - J(B \cup \{h\}) \geq 0$. We consider two cases.\\
Case 1. $J(B) - J(B \cup \{h\}) = 0.$ Then $J(A) - J(A \cup \{h\}) \geq 0$ yields $J(A) - J(A \cup \{h\}) \geq J(B) - J(B \cup \{h\})$.\\
Case 2. $J(B) - J(B \cup \{h\}) = k > 0.$ Let $s_{1},...,s_{k}$ be all the states in $V$ that satisfy $h_{max}(s_{i}, B) \leq  C\sp{*} - g(s_{i})$ and $h_{max}(s_{i}, B \cup \{h\}) > C\sp{*} - g(s_{i}).$  This implies $h(s_{i}) > C\sp{*} - g(s_{i}),$ for all $i \in \{1,...,k\}$ Further, since $A \subset B,$ we have $h_{max}(s_{i}, A) \leq h_{max}(s_{i},B) \leq C\sp{*} - g(s_{i}),$ for all $i \in \{1,...,k\}.$ Consequently, $J(A) - J(A \cup \{h\}) \geq k = J(B) - J(B \cup \{h\}).$
\label{le:lemmatwo}
\end{lemma}

A stronger version of Lemma \ref{le:lemmaone} can be proven: if $S(\zeta\sp{'}) denotes the set of states \{s \in V | h_{max}(s,\zeta\sp{'}) \leq C\sp{*} - g(s)\},$ so that $J(\zeta\sp{'})$ is the cardinality of $S\sp{'}$, we obtain

\begin{equation}
S(\zeta\sp{'} \cup \{h\}) \subseteq S(\zeta\sp{'})\ for\  any\ h.
\label{eq:eq_cardinality}
\end{equation}

Similarly, one can strengthen the statement of Lemma \ref{le:lemmatwo}: the proof given above contains the core idea for proving $S(A) \backslash S(A \cup \{h\}) \supseteq S(B) \backslash S(B \cup \{h\}),$ which, together with Equation \ref{eq:eq_cardinality}, immediately implies the weaker statement $J(A) - J(A \cup \{h\}) \geq J(B) - J(B \cup \{h\}).$ In the form stated above, however, Lemma \ref{le:lemmaone} and \ref{le:lemmatwo} are alredy sufficient for using a result by \cite{nemhauser1978analysis} to conclude the following.

\begin{theorem}
Let $\zeta\sp{'}$ be a subset selected by \texttt{GHS}. Then $J(\zeta\sp{'}, \nabla)$ is within a factor of $\dfrac{e+1}{e} \approx 1.36$ of optimal.
\label{th:theorem_one}
\end{theorem}

Let $T(\zeta\sp{'},\nabla)$ be an approximation to the running time of A$\sp{*}$ when using $h_{max}(\zeta\sp{'})$ for solving $\nabla$, defined as follows.

\begin{equation}
T(\zeta\sp{'}, \nabla) = J(\zeta\sp{'},\nabla) \times t_{h_{max}}(\zeta\sp{'})
\label{eq:eq_time_solving}
\end{equation}

where, for any heuristic function $h$, the term $t_{h}$ refers to the running time used for computing the $h-$value of any state $s$. \\
In order to compute the running time of A$\sp{*}$ exactly we would also have to account for the time required for node generation and for the operations on A$\sp{*}$'s \texttt{OPEN} and \texttt{CLOSED} lists. However, these two factors do not depend directly on the heuristic employed. Thus, $T(\zeta\sp{'},\nabla)$ is reasonable approximation for A$\sp{*}$'s running time for the heuristic subset selection problem.

\begin{theorem}
Suppose $t_{h_{1}} = t_{h_{2}}$ for any $h_{1}$ and $h_{2} \in \zeta$. Then for any fixed subset size $N$, \texttt{GHS} yields a subset $\zeta\sp{'}$ that is within a factor $\dfrac{e+1}{e}$ of optimal with respect to $T(\zeta\sp{'},\nabla)$
\label{th:theorem_two}
\end{theorem}

$Proof.$ Since $t_{h}$ is constant over $h \in \zeta$, the value $t_{h_{max}}(\zeta\sp{'})$ is independent of $\zeta\sp{'}$. Hence the value $T(\zeta\sp{'},\nabla)$ is a constant factor of $J(\zeta\sp{'},\nabla).$ The latter is within a factor of $\dfrac{e+1}{e}$ of optimal by Theorem \ref{th:theorem_one}.

\section{Stratified Sampling (SS)}
Stratified Sampling is a prediction algorithm that estimate the number of nodes expanded by some heuristic.\\

\cite{knuth1975Estimating} created a method to estimate the size of the search tree such as IDA$\sp{*}$. It works doing random walk from the root of the tree. Knuth's assumption is that all branches have the same structure. So, performing a random walk down one branch is enought to estimate the size of the search tree. However, the method does not work well for unbalanced search tree. \cite{chen1992heuristic}
 solved this problem with a stratification of the search tree through a \textit{type system} to reduce the variance of the sampling process\cite{lelis2013predicting}

In the figure \ref{fig:ss_ts} each node of the Search Space is mapped to the \textit{Type System}

\subsection{Type System}
The \textit{Type System} is a partition of the states in the state space. It is calculated based of any property of each node in the search tree. \cite{Lelis2013CC}

A common misconception is think of \textit{type system} as state$-$space abstractions. \cite{Prieditis93} defines a state$-$space abstraction as a simplified version of the problem in which:
\begin{itemize}
\item The cost of the least$-$cost path between two abstracted states must less than or equal to the cost of the least$-$cost path between the corresponding two states in the original state$-$space.
\item Goal states in the original state$-$space must be goal states in the abstracted state$-$space.
\end{itemize}

In contrast with state$-$space abstractions, a \textit{type system} does not have these two requeriments. A \textit{type system} is just a partition of the nodes in the search tree.

The \textit{type system} can not be represented as a graph since \textit{type system} does not necessarily define relation between the types.

The relation between \textit{type system} and abstractions is the following: The \textit{type system} can not necessarily be used as abstractions, abstractions can always be used as \textit{type system}.

\section{Search Space and Search Tree}
\cite{lelis2013predicting} defines the search space and search tree in the following way: Let the \textit{underlying search tree} (\textit{UST}) be the full brute$-$force tree created from a connected, undirected and implicitely defined \textit{underlying search graph} (\textit{USG}) describing a state space. Some search algorithms expand a subtree of the \textit{UST} while searching for a solution (\textsf{e.g.,} a portion of the \textit{UST} might not be expanded due to heuristic guidance); we call this subtree the \textit{expanded search tree} \textit{(EST)}.\\

Let $G = (N,E)$ be a graph representing an \textit{ESG} where $N$ is its set of states and for each $n \in N op(n) = {op_{i}|(n, n_i) \in E}$ is its set of operators.

\theoremstyle{definition}
\begin{definition}{Type System}
Let S = (N,E) be a UST. $T = \{t_{1},...,t_{n} \}$ is a type system for S if it is a disjoint partitioning of N. If $n \in N$ and $t \in T$ with $n \in t$, we write $T(n) = t$. \\
\end{definition}

In this thesis we use \textit{type system} based only in heuristics.\cite{zahavi2010predicting} use the simpliest heuristic$-$based \textit{type system} in which two nodes $n$ and $n\sp{'}$ are of the same type if they have the same heuristic value. \\

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\begin{forest}
 [\usebox\myboxc \hspace*{1.4in} \usebox\myboxb]
\end{forest}
\caption{The heuristic value is the position of the empty tile in a Specific state.} \label{fig:type_system}
\end{figure}

Let's explain how \textit{type system} works through an example. The problem of 8$-$tile$-$puzzle in the Figure \ref{fig:type_system}, the center tile is labeled with the letter \texttt{M} and the courners are labeled with \texttt{C} and the mediums with \texttt{E}. For this problem, for example, we can define the \textit{type system} based on the position of the empty tile regarding the position of the empty tile in the goal State. For this case, two nodes $n$ and $n\sp{'}$ would be of the same type if $n$ and $n\sp{'}$ have the blank tile with the same letter and with the same distance to the empty tile of the goal state.\\

In the Figure \ref{fig:empty_space_ts}, each row represent a type. The first board shows the empty tile in the center with distance to the empty tile in the goal state equal to 2, down left and right down. Then, the type would be (2,M). In the next board the empty tile is in the left top corner, and use the letter \textit{C}. The minimum distance is 4 because to get the goal empty tile is necessary to do: down, down, right, right or right, right, down, down, etc. So the type would be (4, C). In the next board there are two tiles that have the same type, because both have the same letter \textit{M} with distance equal to 3. Then, both have the type (3,E). The fourth row have two boards with the same type, because both have the same letter \textit{C} with distance equal to 2. Then, both have the type (2,C). The fifth row have two boards with the same type, because both have the same letter \textit{E} with distance equal to 1. Then, both have the type (1,E). In the last row the empty tile is in the goal empty tile. So, the distance is zero and the letter is \textit{C}. The type would be (0,C).

% -- Explaining Stratified Sampling
In the Figure \ref{fig:ts_search_tree}, we can see how \textit{Type System} works. In the Level 1, we have the root node, we add the property called weight or (\textit{W}) initialized with one. Let's suppose that three nodes are generated by the root node in the Level 2. The nodes in the Level 2 have the following types: red, blue and red respectively, and each node recive the same \textit{W} of the father. In the Level 2 we apply the concept of \textit{Type System}, two states in the same level that have the same type (The same color) root subtrees  of the same type and only one state per state must be explored. There are two nodes with type red in Level 2. So, we choose randomly one of them. Let's suppose we choose the right red node. Then, we have to update the number of nodes with the type red using the \textit{W}, both red node types have \textit{W = 1}, then we sum the \textit{W} and the the new \textit{W = 2}. So, in the Level 2 we will have two nodes of red type and one node with blue type. \\

When nodes in the Level 2 are expanded. The blue node expands one node of type blue and the red node expands two nodes of type red and blue. The question here is how many nodes would be generated in the Level 3? The answer is: $1 \times \textcolor{cyan}{blue} + 2 \times \textcolor{red}{red} + 2 \times \textcolor{cyan}{blue}$. So, in the Level 3 we will have 2 nodes of red type and 3 nodes of type blue. \\ 

In the Level 3 the \textit{W} of the node blue would be the same \textit{W} of the father. The father has the \textit{W = 1}, then the child has the \textit{W = 1}. The \textit{W} of the red type and blue type would be 2. Once the \textit{W} has been updated for each node in the Level 3 we apply the concept of \textit{Type System} again. There are two nodes with type blue. So, we choose randomly one of them and update the \textit{W}. Let's choose the right blue type and the updated \textit{W} would be 3 because 1 from the left blue type plus the 2 from the right blue type. \\

When nodes in the Level 3 are expanded. The red node expands two nodes of types red and blue and the blue node expands one of the red. How many nodes would be generated at Level 4? The answer is: $2 \times \textcolor{red}{red} + 3 \times \textcolor{red}{red} + 2 \times \textcolor{cyan}{blue}$. So, in the Level 4 we will have five nodes of type red and two nodes of type blue.\\

The number of nodes expanded in the search tree is obtained summing all \textit{W} plus one (The root node). So, the number of nodes expanded in the search tree would be $ 15 + 1 = 16$. \\
