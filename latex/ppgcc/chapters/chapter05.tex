\noindent
This dissertation showed that the problem of finding the optimal subset of a set of heuristics $\zeta$ for a given problem task is solved using the models of A$\sp{*}$ search tree size and, under mild assumptions, with respect to the A$\sp{*}$ running time. Thus, the \texttt{GHS} algorithm which selects heuristics from $\zeta$ one at a time is able to produce a good subset $\zeta\sp{'}$, with respect to the search tree size. Furthermore, if all heuristics in $\zeta$ have the same evaluation time, then we have a good subset selection with respect to running time. In addition to minimizing the search tree size and the running time, we also experimented with an objective function that accounts for the sum of heuristic values in the state-space, as suggested by Rayner et al., (\citeyear{raynersss13}).

Since we cannot compute the values of the objective functions exactly, \texttt{GHS} effectiveness depends on the quality of the approximations we can obtain. We tested two prediction algorithms, \texttt{CS} and \texttt{SS}, for estimating the values of the objective functions and showed empirically that both \texttt{CS} and \texttt{SS} allow \texttt{GHS} to make good subset selections with respect to the search tree size and running time.

Finally, experiments on optimal domain-independent problems showed that \texttt{GHS} minimizing approximations of the A$\sp{*}$ running time outperformed all the other approaches tested, which demostrates the effectiveness of our method for the heuristic subset selection problem.
