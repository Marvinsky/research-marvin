\chapter{Concluding Remarks}\label{ch:conclusions}

\noindent
This dissertation showed that the problem of finding the subset of a set of heuristics $\zeta$ for a given problem task is solved using models of A$\sp{*}$ search tree size and models of the A$\sp{*}$ running time. We introduced the \texttt{GHS} algorithm which selects heuristics from $\zeta$ one at a time and is able to produce a good subset $\zeta\sp{'}$, with respect to the search tree size. In addition to minimizing the search tree size and the running time, we also experimented with an objective function that accounts for the sum of heuristic values in the state-space, as suggested by Rayner et al., (\citeyear{raynersss13}).

Since we cannot compute the values of the objective functions exactly, \texttt{GHS} effectiveness depends on the quality of the approximations we can obtain. We tested two prediction algorithms, \texttt{CS} and \texttt{SS}, for estimating the values of the objective functions and showed empirically that both \texttt{CS} and \texttt{SS} allow \texttt{GHS} to make good subset selections with respect to the search tree size and running time.

Finally, experiments on optimal domain-independent problems showed that \texttt{GHS} minimizing approximations of the A$\sp{*}$ running time outperformed all the other approaches tested, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our method for the heuristic subset selection problem.
