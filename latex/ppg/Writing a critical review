. The topic, or the main question it proposes to answer.
R: Finding a subset of heuristic will help to solve problems quickly?

. Why does the author think the question(s) is important?
R: Because that is the main aim of the research. Which is develop an approach for selecting a subset of heuristic functions with the goal of reducing the running time of search algorithms employing these functions.

.The arguments (answers with reasons) that it makes.
R: Marvin's idea about selecting subset of heuristics from a large set seems especially relevant for domain-independent planning.
Marvin also claims that even though Stratified Sampling (SS) does not make even reasonable predictions for the number of nodes expanded by A*. He would like to verify whether these predictions can be helpful in selecting a subset of heuristics to guide the A* search.

.The sructure of the text or the method used to answer the question.
R:The method used is developed under the assumption that given a large set of heuristics we always can obtain a subset that is results of maximazing subsets of heuristics.

.The evidence used to support answers.
R: Marvin's evidence are the experiments evaluated in Fast Downward[Helmert, 2006] and compared with other planners (page 3).
