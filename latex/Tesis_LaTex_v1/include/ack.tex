\noindent I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor Dr. Gerardo Padilla, for the continuous support and guidance during the thesis process. His valuable advice, patience and encouragement have been of great
importance for this work. \\

Besides my advisor, I would like to thank the rest of the thesis committee: Dra. Gema Gudi\~no and Dr. Ivan Romero, for their insightful feedback, interest and tough questions. \\

EGIA, particularly the MCC program with all its members, played an invaluable role in my graduate education. \\

Last, but not least, I would like to thank my parents and family.
