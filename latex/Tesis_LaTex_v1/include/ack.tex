\noindent I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor PhD. Levi Henrique Santana de Lelis, for the continuous support and guidance during the thesis process. His valuable advice, patience and encouragement have been of great
importance for this work. \\

Besides my advisor, I would like to thank to my co$-$advisor: PhD. Santiago Franco for his insightful feedback, interest and tough questions.

To the professors of the DTI, particularly the Master Degree program with all its members, played an invaluable role in my graduate education. \\

Last, but not least, I would like to thank my Mother.
